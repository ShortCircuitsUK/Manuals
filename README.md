You will find 2 versions of each manual in each kit's relevant folder. The main manuals are intended for screen use (white text on black background). 

If you insist on printing out the manuals, please use the file ending with _BW. These do not include the component index and have black text on a white background.

Short Circuits' Manuals are not to be changed or distributed elsewhere. They are for the sole use of the kits. 
The information and code contained within them can be copied and used elsewhere, but the format, style, logos etc. are Copywrited by Short Circuits.
